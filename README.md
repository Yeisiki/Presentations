## About
This repository houses a compilation of my presentations delivered at conferences, seminars, and other professional events. Each presentation folder contains the slide deck, accompanying materials, and any additional resources that supplement the presentation content.

## Presentations
In this section, you will find folders dedicated to individual presentations. Each folder is named according to the presentation's title or topic, and it contains the presentation slides in a commonly used format (such as PDF or PowerPoint). Additionally, you may find any relevant handouts, scripts, or other resources associated with the presentation.

## Contributing
At the moment, I am solely responsible for adding presentations to this repository. However, if you have suggestions, feedback, or improvements related to any specific presentation, please feel free to open an issue or reach out to me directly.
